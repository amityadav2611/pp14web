#### info about this folder

This folder contains multiple files eg: a.txt, index.js and readme.

*a.txt is a normal text file used as demo input for file index.js file commands.

*index.js file contains a set of codes. We have to write certain command in vscode terminal to run those set of codes.

*VS code command include following:

1. node index.js -rs a.txt         // to remove space in a single line

2. node index.js -rn a.txt //to remove enter(new line) from multiple lines.

3. node index.js -rsc a.txt % //to remove special characters followed by % sign

4. node index.js -s a.txt

//to add sequence at the start of a line 

eg: 

1 abc, 

2 xyz

node index.js -sn a.txt         //to add sequence to a non empty line.

node index.js -rel a.txt        // to remove extra lines from file a.txt.
